            <p>This is super basic, but I wanted to include it.</p>

            <p>I’m a serial eat-outer, and would sometimes combine that with my habit of taking walks in the neighborhood at odd hours. I wanted a comprehensive idea of my options.</p>

            <p>I remember looking up restaurants’ websites, putting their hours in a spreadsheet, and then counting out cells in my notebook with a pencil. It’s the first thing I ever tried after my boss let me borrow his copies of Edward Tufte’s books, and I got into all this.</p>
            <p>Food spots are ordered roughly by their distance from my apartment at the time. In this way, it’s personalized, like an analog, frozen “Food Near Me” maps search.</p>

            <h1>Dessert</h1>
            <p>Charting out the rest of the week would be a perfect use case for a small multiple.</p>

            <p>It could be fun to find an API to dynamically pull hours from restaurants’ online listings, in case hours change, or just for the principle of dynamic data drawing.</p>

            <p>I could also use a current location API to display restaurants within some set walkable distance for the viewer’s current location.</p>

            <p>But at this point I’d just be reinventing the Google Maps “Explore feature.“ For now, I think I like it better as a manual exercise. (Did I mention I drew this in a booth at Yesterdog? I could’ve been at Pita House the whole time.)</p>
